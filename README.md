I don't play OSRS anymore so these are not maintained.

Deadman Plugin will send a desktop alert every tick that it detects a player as well as an in-game message with their name and combat level.
By default it is configured to ignore safezones, however, safezone mapping is not exact.

The Inferno plugin simply paints red/blue/green squares at the top-right depending on the incoming attack. Best used in fixed mode. This is meant as an additional helper and not a replacement for the existing Inferno plugin.
